CS248Project

#This is the repo for Arjun Arora's CS248 NN-renderer project. This is based of the Gaussian Materials Synthesis paper's Neural renderer: https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/gfx/gaussian-material-synthesis/

#Ipython notebook is located in CNN-renderer

#Setup 

1a. Install requirements.txt using preferred package manager 

  or 

1b. Install Conda and use attached conda enviornment: cs248.yml
    -conda env create -f cs248.yml

2. To run pretrained models go to CNN-renderer/CNN-Renderer.ipynb and all cells from Setup to Train-CNN

3. Then Run Eval-CNN

4. Then feel free to run any of the provided models!

5. Output images are output to CS248Project/CNN-renderer

6. Output loss curves are in CS248Project/Models/CNN
